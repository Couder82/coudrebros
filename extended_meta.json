However my life wouldn't be complete without my hobbies - literature, music, yoga, bicycling, analogue photography...and many others. Since the 80's, when I shared Atari 800 XE with my brother, I'm interested in computers. During my life on student's dormitory in 00's I discovered the world of open source software and Linux and few years later this experience led me to discovery of cryptocurrencies.
I see Cardano as the 3rd generation and ecologically sustainable cryptocurrency with a huge potential. I made some investments to ADA and right now I'm building a Cardano node (in cooperation with my brother).",
